Let us consider an example of integer array : a[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}

Here the sizeof(a) function returns the number of bytes taken by the array. 
The sizeof(int) returns the number of bytes taken by an integer element. 

So for getting the number of elements in the array we have to do: sizeof(a)/sizeof(int). Here size = 7.
