1. For removing duplicates using set:

	iterate through the vector and insert the elements into the set: O(n)
	Iterate throught the set and insert in vector : O(n)
	Delete the remaining part of the vector : O(n)
	
		Ans =>> O(n) + O(n) + O(n) = O(n)
		
   For removing duplicates without using set:
   
   	We are using the concept where we rempve all the duplicates of each element one after the other. 
   	This way to remove one element's duplicates we have to traverse the vector everty time.
   	
   	Traversing ---> O(n)    total traverses = n
   	
   	Ans ===> n * O(n) = O(n^2)
