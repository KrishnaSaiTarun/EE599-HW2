1. Swapping index of a string. 

	The input is straight forward and we can directly access the indexes. the swapping operation takes O(1) time. 
	
2. reversing a string

	Just used an extra char but apart from that did it in place.
	The string is traversed from left and rigth towards center. Its one pass
	
	Let n be the length of the string. 
	
	So the time complexity is O(n).
	
3. lower case conversion. 

	We used the function to lower. 
	If it is an upper case alphabet it will convert to lower by changing the ascii value. This is constant time operation. 
	If it is not an upper case alphabet, it will just ignore it. 
	
	This is done for all the letters, so its a one pass algo. 
	
	The time complexity is O(n) assuming that the n is the length of the string!
