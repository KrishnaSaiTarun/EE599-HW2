1. palindrome

	The algorithm just chackes if the characters are the same in the backward and the forward direction and is one pass
	
	===> O(n) where n is the length of the string!
	
2. Approximate palindrome 

	The algorithm just chackes if the characters are the same in the backward and the forward direction and skips the unwanted characters. It is one pass
	
	===> O(n) where n is the length of the string!
