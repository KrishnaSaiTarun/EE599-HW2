Mapping 

	The algorithm runs through both the strings and adds every distimct element into the map. 
	When an key is encountered that is already there, then if the value is not matching then mapping is not possible. 
	
	We go through the strings once and the operations on map are considered O(1). 
	
	So it is a one pass on the string and the time complexity is O(n) where n is the length of the string. (Both strings need to be of same length else mapping not possible.)
