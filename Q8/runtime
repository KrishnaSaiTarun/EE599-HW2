The algorithm for flinding median:

	Sort the vector and find the mid point. 
	
	Sorting ==> O(nlogn) assuming vector of size n. 
	
	Then flipping is basic swapping of elements and is a one pass. once on the left of median and one on the right of median. 
	
	Therefore, the flipping part is just O(n).
	
	===> O(nlogn) + O(n) = O(nlogn).
